A script originally designed for checking all finishes to the NRL season, though is fairly easy to adapt to other sports too.

Features:
  - [x] Speed: runs at approximately 10 million checks / hr
  - [x] Saves check data to storage rather than to RAM, slowing down the program
  - [x] Computes expected wins
  - [x] Approximates the $Pr(\text{Team X wins match}~ | ~\text{Team Y achieves season result 'Z'})$
